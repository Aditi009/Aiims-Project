                                <b>Dear Friends,</b>
                                <br>
                                Wishing all of you a very happy and productive year! We are happy to announce that we will be conducting the Comprehensive Symposium on Ultrasound for the Anaesthesiologist (CUSA) from the 24 th to the 26 th of February 2023!
                                
                                As always CUSA 2023 is going to be an academic feast! There will be demonstration of anatomy in cadavers with the active participation of our colleagues from the Department of Anatomy.
                                
                                Scanning of sonoanatomy in volunteers, practice needling in cadavers, interactive talks and discussions will all be a part of this Symposium! The highlight of CUSA this time is going to be revisiting all blocks from the classic to the most recent approaches. I am sure you want to know when and how to do a selective superior, intermediate or inferior trunk block instead of a supraclavicular block! I am sure time and again you needed to use the ultrasound for a difficult back in a high risk patient and rued that you could not do so optimally! After CUSA, with the help of our dedicated national and international faculty.
                            </p>

                                your doubts are cleared and you are as adept at the newer blocks and techniques as the old ones!
                                There will also be a session on Point of Care ultrasound (POCUS) for the anaesthesiologist. This will include gastric ultrasound, airway ultrasound, lung ultrasound, transthoracic
                                echocardiography and ultrasound for venous access. The faculty involved in POCUS are experts who will make it possible for you to assimilate
                                POCUS in your day to day practice!
                                <br>
                                Need I say more …………. CUSA is a Regional anaesthesia Symposium with a difference !
